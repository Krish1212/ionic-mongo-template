# Ionic Mongo Template
## Introduction
  This template uses the following technologies or frameworks
  - Node JS
  - Server
    - Mongo DB
    - NestJS
    - Mongoose
  - Client
    - Ionic with Angular

## Database
  This project uses Mongo DB which is a document based database. Each document is basically an Object which need not have to follow a particular pattern. This is also a non-relational database in which a specific group of common type documents could be grouped as a "collection" which is same as the "Table" in a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System).

### NestJS
  The NestJS is a NodeJS framework that provides the server service and acts as the bridge connecting the Mongo DB to the frontend (Ionic). All the backend services are driven using the NestJS framework. This is somewhat similar to the Angular approach, so usage will not be different for most Angular framework users.

### Mongoose
  The Mongoose is a NodeJS framework that helps to connect to the MongoDB and makes the conversation with MongoDB easier.
